# respawn-mdl
Various structs for Respawn's models including ones unchanged from normal Source Engine (V49, V48, and more).


Many of the default Valve ones have been sourced from their public source code such as in Alien Swarm and SDK-2013, however please ask before using any Respawn related structs in any form of project.


Currently these templates work for:

Valve:

  -V47 (with original Xbox structs as well)  
  -V48  
  -V49 (Portal 2 and Alien Swarm branches)	

Respawn:

  -V52  
  -V53  
  -V54 with subversions: 8/9/10/11/12/12.1/12.2/13/14/15	
  
As well as structs for:
  
  -VPHY	
  -RPHY (incomplete)	
  -VTX subversions: 7	
  -VVD	
  -VVC	 
  -VG (soon)

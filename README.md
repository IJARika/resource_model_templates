# respawn-mdl
Various structs for Respawn's models including ones unchanged from normal Source Engine (V48 & V49)


Currently these templates work for:

Valve:

  -V48
  
  -V49

Respawn:

  -V52
  
  -V53
  
  -V54 subversions: 8/9/10/11/12
  
  -V54 subversion: 13
  
  -V54 subversion: 14
  


Versions V52 & V53 have the best support.

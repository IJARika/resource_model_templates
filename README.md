# respawn-mdl
Various structs for Respawn's models including ones unchanged from normal Source Engine (V47/V48/V49)


Many of the default Valve ones have been sourced from their public source code such as alien swap and sdk-2013, however please ask before using any Respawn related structs in any form of project.


Currently these templates work for:

Valve:

  -V47 (with original xbox version)  
  -V48  
  -V49 (not csgo)	

Respawn:

  -V52  
  -V53  
  -V54 subversions: 8/9/10/11/12/12.1/12.2/13/14(.1?)
  
As well as:
  
  -VPHY   
  -RPHY (incomplete)  
  -VTX subversions: 7 	
  -VVD    
  -VVC (partial)  
  -VG (soon)
